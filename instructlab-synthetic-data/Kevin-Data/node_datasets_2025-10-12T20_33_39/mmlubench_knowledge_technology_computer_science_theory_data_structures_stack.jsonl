{"document":"Stack_(abstract_data_type)\nHistory\nStacks entered the computer science literature in 1946, when Alan Turing used the terms \"bury\" and \"unbury\" as a means of calling and returning from subroutines. Subroutines and a two-level stack had already been implemented in Konrad Zuse's Z4 in 1945.\nKlaus Samelson and Friedrich L. Bauer of Technical University Munich proposed the idea of a stack called Operationskeller (\"operational cellar\") in 1955 and filed a patent in 1957. In March 1988, by which time Samelson was deceased, Bauer received the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award for the invention of the stack principle. Similar concepts were independently developed by Charles Leonard Hamblin in the first half of 1954 and by Wilhelm K\u00e4mmerer with his automatisches Ged\u00e4chtnis (\"automatic memory\") in 1958.\nStacks are often described using the analogy of a spring-loaded stack of plates in a cafeteria. Clean plates are placed on top of the stack, pushing down any plates already there. When the top plate is removed from the stack, the one below it is elevated to become the new top plate.","icl_document":"Another option for implementing stacks is to use a singly linked list.

{"document":"Stack_(abstract_data_type)\nSoftware stacks\nImplementation\nA stack can be easily implemented either through an array or a linked list, as it is merely a special case of a list. In either case, what identifies the data structure as a stack is not the implementation but the interface: the user is only allowed to pop or push items onto the array or linked list, with few other helper operations. The following will demonstrate both implementations using pseudocode.\n=### Array=\nAn array can be used to implement a (bounded) stack, as follows. The first element, usually at the zero offset, is the bottom, resulting in array[0] being the first element pushed onto the stack and the last element popped off. The program must keep track of the size (length) of the stack, using a variable top that records the number of items pushed so far, therefore pointing to the place in the array where the next element is to be inserted (assuming a zero-based index convention). Thus, the stack itself can be effectively implemented as a three-element structure:\nstructure stack:\nmaxsize : integer\ntop : integer\nitems : array of item\nprocedure initialize(stk : stack, size : integer):\nstk.items \u2190 new array of size items, initially empty\nstk.maxsize \u2190 size\nstk.top \u2190 0\nThe push operation adds an element and increments the top index, after checking for overflow:\nprocedure push(stk : stack, x : item):\nif stk.top = stk.maxsize:\nreport overflow error\nelse:\nstk.items[stk.top] \u2190 x\nstk.top \u2190 stk.top + 1\nSimilarly, pop decrements the top index after checking for underflow, and returns the item that was previously the top one:\nprocedure pop(stk : stack):\nif stk.top = 0:\nreport underflow error\nelse:\nstk.top \u2190 stk.top \u2212 1\nr \u2190 stk.items[stk.top]\nreturn r","icl_document":"In many implementations, a stack has more operations than the essential \"push\" and \"pop\" operations.

{"document":"Stack_(abstract_data_type)\nApplications of stacks\nBacktracking\nAnother important application of stacks is backtracking. An illustration of this is the simple example of finding the correct path in a maze that contains a series of points, a starting point, several paths and a destination. If random paths must be chosen, then after following an incorrect path, there must be a method by which to return to the beginning of that path. This can be achieved through the use of stacks, as a last correct point can be pushed onto the stack, and popped from the stack in case of an incorrect path.\nThe prototypical example of a backtracking algorithm is depth-first search, which finds all vertices of a graph that can be reached from a specified starting vertex. Other applications of backtracking involve searching through spaces that represent potential solutions to an optimization problem. Branch and bound is a technique for performing such backtracking searches without exhaustively searching all of the potential solutions in such a space.","icl_document":"In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements with two\nmain operations:\nPush, which adds an element to the collection, and\nPop, which removes the most recently added element.\nAdditionally, a peek operation can, without modifying the stack, return the value of the last element\nadded (the item at the top of the stack).

{"document":"Stack_(abstract_data_type)\nApplications of stacks\nCompile-time memory management\nA number of programming languages are stack-oriented, meaning they define most basic operations (adding two numbers, printing a character) as taking their arguments from the stack, and placing any return values back on the stack. For example, PostScript has a return stack and an operand stack, and also has a graphics state stack and a dictionary stack. Many virtual machines are also stack-oriented, including the p-code machine and the Java Virtual Machine.\nAlmost all calling conventions\u200d\u2014\u200cthe ways in which subroutines receive their parameters and return results\u200d\u2014\u200cuse a special stack (the \"call stack\") to hold information about procedure\/function calling and nesting in order to switch to the context of the called function and restore to the caller function when the calling finishes. The functions follow a runtime protocol between caller and callee to save arguments and return value on the stack. Stacks are an important way of supporting nested or recursive function calls. This type of stack is used implicitly by the compiler to support CALL and RETURN statements (or their equivalents) and is not manipulated directly by the programmer.\nSome programming languages use the stack to store data that is local to a procedure. Space for local data items is allocated from the stack when the procedure is entered, and is deallocated when the procedure exits. The C programming language is typically implemented in this way. Using the same stack for both data and procedure calls has important security implications (see below) of which a programmer must be aware in order to avoid introducing serious security bugs into a program.","icl_document":"In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements with two\nmain operations:\nPush, which adds an element to the collection, and\nPop, which removes the most recently added element.\nAdditionally, a peek operation can, without modifying the stack, return the value of the last element\nadded (the item at the top of the stack).

{"document":"Stack_(abstract_data_type)\nApplications of stacks\nEfficient algorithms\nSeveral algorithms use a stack (separate from the usual function call stack of most programming languages) as the principal data structure with which they organize their information. These include:\nGraham scan, an algorithm for the convex hull of a two-dimensional system of points. A convex hull of a subset of the input is maintained in a stack, which is used to find and remove concavities in the boundary when a new point is added to the hull.\nPart of the SMAWK algorithm for finding the row minima of a monotone matrix uses stacks in a similar way to Graham scan.\nAll nearest smaller values, the problem of finding, for each number in an array, the closest preceding number that is smaller than it. One algorithm for this problem uses a stack to maintain a collection of candidates for the nearest smaller value. For each position in the array, the stack is popped until a smaller value is found on its top, and then the value in the new position is pushed onto the stack.\nThe nearest-neighbor chain algorithm, a method for agglomerative hierarchical clustering based on maintaining a stack of clusters, each of which is the nearest neighbor of its predecessor on the stack. When this method finds a pair of clusters that are mutual nearest neighbors, they are popped and merged.","icl_document":"In many implementations, a stack has more operations than the essential \"push\" and \"pop\" operations.

A stack pointer (usually in the form of a processor register) points to\nthe most recently referenced location on the stack; when the stack has a size of zero, the stack\npointer points to the origin of the stack.\nThe two operations applicable to all stacks are:\nA push operation: the address in the stack pointer is adjusted by the size of the data item and a data\nitem is written at the location to which the stack pointer points.\nA pop or pull operation: a data item at the current location to which the stack pointer points is read,\nand the stack pointer is moved by a distance corresponding to the size of that data item.\nThere are many variations on the basic principle of stack operations. Every stack has a fixed location\nin memory at which it begins. As data items are added to the stack, the stack pointer is displaced to\nindicate the current extent of the stack, which expands away from the origin.\nStack pointers may point to the origin of a stack or to a limited range of addresses above or below the\norigin (depending on the direction in which the stack grows); however, the stack pointer cannot cross\nthe origin of the stack. In other words, if the origin of the stack is at address 1000 and the stack\ngrows downwards (towards addresses 999, 998, and so on), the stack pointer must never be incremented\nbeyond 1000 (to 1001 or beyond). If a pop operation on the stack causes the stack pointer to move past\nthe origin of the stack, a stack underflow occurs. If a push operation causes the stack pointer to\nincrement or decrement beyond the maximum extent of the stack, a stack overflow occurs.\n","document_outline":"Overview of the stack abstract data type, covering its definition, operations, implementations using arrays\nand linked lists, and basic hardware architecture.\n","subject":"computer_science","leaf_node_type":"knowledge","icl_query_1":"What is a stack pointer?\n","icl_response_1":"A stack pointer is a register that points to the top of the stack in memory.
