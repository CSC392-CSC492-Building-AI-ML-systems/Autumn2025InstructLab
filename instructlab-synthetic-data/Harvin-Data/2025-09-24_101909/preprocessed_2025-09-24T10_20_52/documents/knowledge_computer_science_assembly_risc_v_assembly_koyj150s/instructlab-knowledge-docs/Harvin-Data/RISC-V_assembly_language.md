# RISC-V assembly language

RISC-V assembly language is a low-level programming language that is used to produce object code for the RISC-V class of processors. Assembly languages are closely tied to the architecture's machine code instructions, allowing for precise control over hardware.
Assemblers include GNU Assembler and LLVM.


## Keywords

Reserved keywords of RISC-V assembly language.


## Mnemonics and opcodes


Each instruction in the RISC-V assembly language is represented by a mnemonic which often combines with one or more operands to translate into one or more bytes known as an opcode.


## Registers


RISC-V processors feature a set of registers that serve as storage for binary data and addresses during program execution. These registers are categorized into integer registers and floating-point registers.


## Instruction types

RISC-V instructions use variable-length encoding.
Extensions:

atomic instructions
single-precision floating-point
double-precision floating-point
bit manipulation
cryptography
hypervisor
supervisor
packed-SIMD instructions
vector


### Floating-point instructions
RISC-V assembly language includes instructions for a floating-point unit (FPU).


### SIMD instructions
These largely perform the same operation in parallel on many values.


## Program flow

The RISC-V assembly has conditional branch instructions based on comparison: beq (equal), bne (not equal), blt (less than, signed), bltu (less than, unsigned), bge (greater than or equal, signed), and bgeu (greater than or equal, unsigned).
