{"document":"Binary_tree\nDefinitions\nRecursive definition\n=### Recursive full tree definition=\nA simple, informal approach to describe a binary tree might be as follows:\na binary tree has a root node, which has 0 or 2 children nodes (which in turn may have their 0 or 2 children, and so on).\nMore formally:\n(base case) There exists a full tree consisting of a single node;\n(recursive step) If T1 and T2 are full binary trees, which do not share any node, and r is a node not belonging to T1 or T2, then the ordered triple (r, T1, T2) is a full binary tree.\nThis definition implies two limitations: a full binary tree contains at least one node, and no node can have only one child. This is resolved with the next definition.\n=### Recursive extended tree definition=\nThe extended tree definition starts with the assumption the tree can be empty.\n(base case) An empty set of nodes is an extended binary tree.\n(recursive step) If T1 and T2 are extended binary trees, which do not share any node, and r is a node not belonging to any of them, then the ordered triple (r, T1, T2) is an extended binary tree.\nTo be complete from the graph point of view, both definitions of a tree should be extended by a definition of the corresponding branches sets. Informally, the branches set can be described as a set of all ordered pairs of nodes (r, s) where r is a root node of any subtree appearing in the definition, and s is a root node of any of its T1 and T2 subtrees (in case the respective subtree is not empty).\nAnother way of imagining this construction (and understanding the terminology) is to consider instead of the empty set a different type of node\u2014for instance square nodes if the regular ones are circles.","icl_document":"In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each\nnode has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right\nchild.

Formally, it can be defined as a recursive triple (L, S, R), where\nS is the root, and L and R are themselves binary trees or empty. From a\ngraph theory view, it is an arborescence \u2014 a rooted directed tree \u2014 that\ncan also be described as an ordered, rooted tree. The important feature is\nthat left and right children are distinguished, which allows the structure\nto support a variety of algorithms and applications.\n","icl_query_2":"How do binary trees differ in usage between searching and representing data?\n","icl_response_2":"Binary trees are applied in two distinct ways. As search structures, they\nare labeled with values that support operations like searching and sorting,\ngiving rise to binary search trees and heaps. In these contexts, the left\nand right designation is essential because it determines ordering. On the\nother hand, binary trees can also represent data with an inherently\nbifurcating structure, such as in Huffman coding or phylogenetic trees,\nwhere the exact arrangement of nodes is part of the encoded information.\nIn these representational uses, the structure itself conveys meaning\nrather than serving only as a tool for efficient operations.\n","icl_query_3":"Why is the distinction between left and right children important in binary trees?\n","icl_response_3":"The distinction matters because many algorithms rely on ordered traversal\nor comparisons. For instance, in a binary search tree, the left child of a\nnode must contain values less than the parent, and the right child must\ncontain values greater. This ordering enables efficient O(log n) searching\nwhen the tree is balanced. Even when a node has only one child, specifying\nwhether it is left or right preserves the ordering consistency, ensuring\ncorrectness of insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.\n","leaf_node_path":"knowledge_technology_programming_data_structures_and_algorithms","mmlubench_question":"What is the height requirement for a binary tree with l leaves to be a balanced full tree?\n\nA) log\u2061\u2082l\nB) log\u2061\u2082(l + 1)\nC) 2\u2071log\u2061\u2082l\nD) 2\u2071(log\u2061\u2082l + 1) - 1","mmlubench_answer":"A) log\u2061\u2082l","dataset_type":"mcq_qa","answer":0,"choices":["log\u2061\u2082l","log\u2061\u2082(l + 1)","2\u2071log\u2061\u2082l","2\u2071(log\u2061\u2082l + 1) - 1"],"question":"What is the height requirement for a binary tree with l leaves to be a balanced full tree?"}

{"document":"Binary_tree\nMethods for storing binary trees\nNodes and references\nIn a language with records and references, binary trees are typically constructed by having a tree node structure which contains some data and references to its left child and its right child. Sometimes it also contains a reference to its unique parent. If a node has fewer than two children, some of the child pointers may be set to a special null value, or to a special sentinel node.\nThis method of storing binary trees wastes a fair bit of memory, as the pointers will be null (or point to the sentinel) more than half the time; a more conservative representation alternative is threaded binary tree.\nIn languages with tagged unions such as ML, a tree node is often a tagged union of two types of nodes, one of which is a 3-tuple of data, left child, and right child, and the other of which is a \"leaf\" node, which contains no data and functions much like the null value in a language with pointers.

One simple method is to traverse the tree in preorder and\noutput \"1\" for an internal node and \"0\" for a leaf. The resulting bitstring\ncan reconstruct the structure without ambiguity. This approach requires\n2n+1 bits for n internal nodes, which matches the information-theoretic\nlower bound up to a small overhead.\n","icl_query_3":"What are the advantages and trade-offs of pointer-based vs. array-based storage?\n","icl_response_3":"Pointer-based storage is flexible, works well for any shape of tree, and\nsupports dynamic insertion and deletion easily. Its drawback is memory\noverhead from unused pointers in sparse trees. Array-based storage, in\ncontrast, is compact and fast for complete trees but wastes space when the\ntree is not dense. It also requires shifting elements if the tree shape\nchanges unpredictably, making it less suited for dynamic structures.\n","leaf_node_path":"knowledge_technology_programming_data_structures_and_algorithms","mmlubench_question":"In which book by Donald Knuth can you find information about Binary Trees, specifically in sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2?\n\nA) The Art of Computer Science vol 1.
